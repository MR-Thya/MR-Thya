### 👋 About Me  
I’m **Thya**, a **Data Science student** who loves exploring how data, algorithms, and creativity can come together to solve real-world problems.
I'd call myself a semi vibe coder, sometimes I dive deep into logic and documentation, other times I just follow the flow and experiment until things work (*which, honestly, mostly never does* 😅).

I’m currently studying **Data Science**, and still learning more about **Artificial Intelligence, Machine Learning, Web, and App Development**.  
I enjoy experimenting with data-driven ideas, understanding how models work behind the scenes, and finding ways to turn insights into interactive applications.  

My goal is to keep from time to time — by experimenting with small projects, learning from others, and exploring how technology can create meaningful impact

When I’m not coding, I usually spend my free time watching tutorials on YouTube and exploring the concepts by experimenting with what I've learned in the videos
I believe that learning is a lifelong journey, and every line of code is a step forward.
